The term t cos(0)sin(0) defines a straight line rotated by an angle 0.
The csv files contain the points x y which are points lying on the curve.
t was assumed to vary normally between 6 and 60.
To check how well the model matches the data, Mean L1 distance was used.
The pron=blem is non linear so two types of optimization was used, Global Optimization and Local Refinement.
Implementation summary is as given below:
Loads the csv file.
Assigns uniform t values between 6 and 60.
Defines the curve model function.
Define the L1 loss.
Run the differential evalution.
Find the best values for 0, X, M.
Compute the L1.
