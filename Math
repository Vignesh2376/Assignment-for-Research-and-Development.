Our goal is to minimize the L1 distance between the observed data and the curve produced by the model.
L1(0, M, X) = 1/N sigma i=1 to N (|xi - xti| + |yi - yti|)
That is min L1(THETA, M, X)
Two optimization was used
1. Global Search - randomly explores all the possible combinations of THETA, M and X and finds the region where the L1 is smallest.
2. Local refinment to improve the value got from global search for more precision.
