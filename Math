Our goal is to minimize the L1 distance between the observed data and the curve produced by the model.
That is min L1(THETA, M, X)
Two optimization was used
1. Global Search - randomly explores all the possible combinations of THETA, M and X and finds the region where the L1 is smallest.
2. Local refinment to improve the value got from global search for more precision.
